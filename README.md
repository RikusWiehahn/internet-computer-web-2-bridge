# Web 2 Bridge for IC Dapps ðŸŒ‰

This repo lets you make json http requests from the internet computer blockchain to the regular internet ðŸ™Œ

## How it works

1. Send an http request from any IC canister to the bridge canister. The bridge canisters aves the request in memory and returns an `id`.
2. An off-chain Node.js server continually pulls http requests from the bridge canister and processes them.
3. The off-chain server sends the responses back to the bridge canister, which saves the response in memory.
4. The original requesting canister can then fetch the response to it's http request from the bridge canister via the `id` that was returned.

## Configuration

This guide assumes you have the usual dev-tools installed, node, npm, dfx etc.

### 3. Create the canisters

Run the command

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploy your bridge and demo canister
dfx canister create --all
```

### 1. Create .env file

Create a file named `.env` in this repo's root directory and paste in the following:

```env
LOCAL_DEV_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID = "<YOUR_LOCAL_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID>"
PRODUCTION_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID = "<YOUR_LIVE_IC_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID>"
LOCAL_DEV_HOST = "http://localhost:8000"
PRODUCTION_HOST = "<YOUR_LIVE_IC_CANISTER_URL>"
BRIDGE_ACCESS_CODE = "<FOR_SECURE_REQUESTS_OVER_THE_BRIDGE>"
```

- Replace `<YOUR_LOCAL_DEV_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID>` with the newly generated **bridge** canister id (in `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`).

- Replace `<FOR_SECURE_REQUESTS_OVER_THE_BRIDGE>` with a random access code (using an ssh keygen etc).

### 2. Keys files

Create a file called `keys.rs` in the bridge canister's folder (`src/bridge`) and paste in the following:

```rs

pub const BRIDGE_ACCESS_CODE: &str = "<KEY_FOR_SECURE_REQUESTS_OVER_THE_BRIDGE>";

```

- Replace `<KEY_FOR_SECURE_REQUESTS_OVER_THE_BRIDGE>` with the random access code you generated earlier.

Create a file called `keys.rs` in the demo canister's folder (`src/demo`) and paste in the following:

```rs
pub const BRIDGE_ACCESS_CODE: &str = "<KEY_FOR_SECURE_REQUESTS_OVER_THE_BRIDGE>";
pub const DEV_DEMO_CANISTER_ID: &str = "<THIS_CANISTERS_LOCAL_DEV_ID>";
pub const DEV_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID: &str = "<YOUR_LOCAL_DEV_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID>";
pub const PROD_DEMO_CANISTER_ID: &str = "<THIS_CANISTERS_PRODUCTION_ID>";
pub const PROD_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID: &str = "<YOUR_LIVE_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID>";
```

- Replace `<KEY_FOR_SECURE_REQUESTS_OVER_THE_BRIDGE>` with the random access code you generated earlier.
- Replace `<THIS_CANISTERS_LOCAL_DEV_ID>` with the **demo** canister id in (`.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`).
- Replace `<YOUR_LOCAL_DEV_BRIDGE_CANISTER_ID>` with the **bridge** canister id in (`.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`).

### 3. Deploy the canisters

Redeploy the canisters now that they are configured:

```bash

# Deploy your bridge and demo canister
dfx deploy

```

### 7. Start the nodejs server

Open a new terminal window and run the following commands:

```bash

npm install

npm run build

npm start

```

- You should see the local replica print out the api response:

```bash

response: Object({"bitcoin": Object({"aud": Number(58993), "brl": Number(220562), "cad": Number(53472), "chf": Number(38845), "dkk": Number(275372), "eur": Number(37017), "gbp": Number(31021), "hkd": Number(327547), "jpy": Number(4849976), "nok": Number(372459), "nzd": Number(63431), "sek": Number(392317), "sgd": Number(56558), "usd": Number(41989)})})

```

### 8. Improvements

If you know how to improve this repo please make a pull request! **Especially** if you know how to:

- Simplify config (less manual copy/pasting)
- Improve efficiency (does IC have a delay function like the thread::sleep function?). At the moment the calling function is horrifically wasteful on cycles.
